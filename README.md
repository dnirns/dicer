# Dicer - a tool kit for online Zoom games

[**Deployed Site**](https://dicer.app/)

A simple React app to fulfil a personal need that came up during a group board game on Zoom during covid lockdown.

We needed everyone to have a dice, timer and a bag of letters to pick from, but it got complicated when not everybody had all of these handy, so I decided to create a simple app that had all of these in one place that we could all access easily.

The options are purposefully limited to the most common uses, for simplicity and ease of use. So far it includes:

- Rolling one or two dice.
- Generating a random letter, equivalent to picking a Scrabble tile from a bag.
- Basic timer with an alarm, presets of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 mins.

It's a work in progress project which I plan on adding bits and pieces to over time as the need arises.
